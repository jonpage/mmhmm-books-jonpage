# mmhmm web take home challenge

See the details of the assignment: [here](https://gist.github.com/RyanWarner/813699004854574c9e84361788c0d6c0)

## Setup

After installing with `pnpm install`, run the dev server with `pnpm dev`.

## Notes

I've set this up with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependency versions.

It is deployed here:

[https://mmhmm-books-jonpage.vercel.app/](https://mmhmm-books-jonpage.vercel.app/)

## Next Steps

Some obvious next steps include:

- support for uploading/sourcing images
- support for pagination (unless infinite scroll is the desired experience)
  - updating server requests to take advantage of pagination
- search over titles/descriptions/authors
